abstract = {The rapid development and large body of literature on machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can make it difficult to know how to proceed for researchers who are not experts but wish to use these tools. The spirit of this review is to help such researchers by serving as a practical, accessible guide to the state-of-the-art in MLIPs. This review paper covers a broad range of topics related to MLIPs, including (i) central aspects of how and why MLIPs are enablers of many exciting advancements in molecular modeling, (ii) the main underpinnings of different types of MLIPs, including their basic structure and formalism, (iii) the potentially transformative impact of universal MLIPs for both organic and inorganic systems, including an overview of the most recent advances, capabilities, downsides, and potential applications of this nascent class of MLIPs, (iv) a practical guide for estimating and understanding the execution speed of MLIPs, including guidance for users based on hardware availability, type of MLIP used, and prospective simulation size and time, (v) a manual for what MLIP a user should choose for a given application by considering hardware resources, speed requirements, energy and force accuracy requirements, as well as guidance for choosing pre-trained potentials or fitting a new potential from scratch, (vi) discussion around MLIP infrastructure, including sources of training data, pre-trained potentials, and hardware resources for training, (vii) summary of some key limitations of present MLIPs and current approaches to mitigate such limitations, including methods of including long-range interactions, handling magnetic systems, and treatment of excited states, and finally (viii) we finish with some more speculative thoughts on what the future holds for the development and application of MLIPs over the next 3–10+ years.}

  abstract = {Abstract Phase boundary is highly recognized for its capability in engineering various physical properties of ferroelectrics. Here, field-induced polarization rotation is reported in a high-performance (K, Na)NbO3-based ferroelectric system at the rhombohedral-tetragonal phase boundary. First, the lattice structure is examined from both macroscopic and local scales, implementing Rietveld refinement and pair distribution function analysis, respectively. The macroscopic phase coexistence at the phase boundary can be interchangeably rationalized with an average projection of collective local disordered units, exhibiting the order–disorder nature. The structural evidence of field-induced polarization rotation is provided by the in situ synchrotron study. Theoretical studies including density functional theory calculation and molecular dynamics simulation also predict the polarization rotation mechanism. The simulation result reveals the variation of the degree of ordering during the polarization rotation as a key feature of the boosted electrical properties in the order–disorder ferroelectric system. The discovery provides meaningful insight into the design of ferroelectrics with enhanced physical properties.},

abstract = {Dual atomic catalysts (DAC), particularly copper (Cu2)-based nitrogen (N) doped graphene, show great potential to effectively convert CO2 and nitrate (NO3−) into important industrial chemicals such as ethylene, glycol, acetamide, and urea through an efficient catalytical process that involves C–C and C–N coupling. However, the origin of the coupling activity remained unclear, which substantially hinders the rational design of Cu-based catalysts for the N-integrated CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). To address this challenge, this work performed advanced density functional theory calculations incorporating explicit solvation based on a Cu2-based N-doped carbon (Cu2N6C10) catalyst for CO2RR. These calculations are aimed to gain insight into the reaction mechanisms for the synthesis of ethylene, acetamide, and urea via coupling in the interfacial reaction micro-environment. Due to the sluggishness of CO2, the formation of a solvation electric layer by anions (F−, Cl−, Br−, and I−) and cations (Na+, Mg2+, K+, and Ca2+) leads to electron transfer towards the Cu surface. This process significantly accelerates the reduction of CO2. These results reveal that *CO intermediates play a pivotal role in N-integrated CO2RR. Remarkably, the Cu2-based N-doped carbon catalyst examined in this study has demonstrated the most potential for C–N coupling to date. Our findings reveal that through the process of a condensation reaction between *CO and NH2OH for urea synthesis, *NO3− is reduced to *NH3, and *CO2 to *CCO at dual Cu atom sites. This dual-site reduction facilitates the synthesis of acetamide through a nucleophilic reaction between NH3 and the ketene intermediate. Furthermore, we found that the I− and Mg2+ ions, influenced by pH, were highly effective for acetamide and ammonia synthesis, except when F− and Ca2+ were present. Furthermore, the mechanisms of C–N bond formation were investigated via ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations, and we found that adjusting the micro-environment can change the dominant side reaction, shifting from hydrogen production in acidic conditions to water reduction in alkaline ones. This study introduces a novel approach using ion-H2O cages to significantly enhance the efficiency of C–N coupling reactions.},
