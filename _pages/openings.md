## Openings for graduate students <br>
**We are always looking for highly motivated PhD candidates to work at the intersection of multiscale simulation, machine learning, polymeric materials, and statistical physics.** Please email Dr. Zhenghao Wu (`zhenghao.wu@xjtlu.edu.cn`) with your CV and short description of your research interest.  <br><br>

## Master students and research volunteers
**We welcome interested Master Students and research volunteers to our lab.** We have multiple projects available for students who are interested in machine learning, molecular modeling, polymer simulations in the general area of chemistry, chemical engineering and physics. We help and encourage master students and research volunteers to wrap up and publish their work in high-impact journals. You can email `zhenghao.wu@xjtlu.edu.cn` with your interests and background.<br><br>

## Undergraduates and high school students<br>
**We welcome interested undergraduates and high school students to our lab.** We have multiple projects available for students who are interested in getting hands-on experience with machine learning, molecular modelling, polymer simulations in the general area of chemistry, physics, and chemical engineering. You can email `zhenghao.wu@xjtlu.edu.cn` with your interests and background.<br><br>
